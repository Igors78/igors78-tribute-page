    <h2 id="headline">Timeline of the compass</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>4BC</strong>  The first compass was believed to have been made in China using lodestone, a natural magnet. Surprisingly the compass was used for fengshui/geomancy (divination from the configuration of a handful of earth or random dots), until 11 AD.</li>
      <li><strong>11 AD</strong>  During the Song dynasty trading ships started using compasses to navigate the seas. This helped them to get all the way to Saudi Arabia without getting lost. Through the silk road compass technology traveled to the muslim world and Europe. The Arabs used compasses primarily for non-navigational purposes, while the Europians used it primarily for navigational purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>1300</strong>  The dry mariners compass had just been invented. It had a freely pivoting needle enclosed in a glass box. However it was large, bulky and clunky.</li>
      <li><strong>1700</strong>  In the 1700's we invented the bearing compass. A bearing compass is a magnetic compass mounted in such a way that it allows the taking of bearings of objects by aligning them with the lubber line (the line showing the direction straight ahead, usally in a plane, compass or ship) of the bearing compass.</li>
      <li><strong>1813</strong>  Liquid compasses were the new advancements at this time. The liquid compass is a design in which the magnetized needle or card is damped by fluid to protect against excessive swing or wobble, improving readability while reducing wear.</li>
      <li><strong>1906</strong>  The gyrocompass is a non-magnetic compass that finds true north, hence innacuraccies like accelaration, magnetic waves and metallic structures are greatly reduced.</li>
      <li><strong>2018</strong>  The GPS is the new compass, we can use it as a compass and as a tracker of where we are.</li>
    </ul>
